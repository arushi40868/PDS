    "# Estimating Labor Market Returns to Education\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to use data from the [American Communities Survey (ACS)](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/acs.shtml) to study the relationship betwen educational attainment and wages. The ACS is a survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau (though it is not \"The Census,\" which is a counting of every person in the United States that takes place every 10 years) to measure numerous features of the US population. The data we will be working with includes about 100 variables from the 2017 ACS survey, and is a 10% sample of the ACS (which itself is a 1% sample of the US population, so we're working with about a 0.1% sample of the United States). \n",
    "\n",
    "This data comes from [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/), which provides a very useful tool for getting subsets of major survey datasets, not just from the US, but [from government statistical agencies the world over](https://international.ipums.org/international-action/sample_details).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is *real* data, meaning that you are being provided the data as it is provided by IPUMS. Documentation for all variables used in this data can be found [here](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group) (you can either search by variable name to figure out the meaning of a variable in this data, or search for something you want to see if a variable with the right name is in this data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Within this data is information on both the educational background and current earnings of a representative sample of Americans. We will now use this data to estimate the labor-market returns to graduating high school and college, and to learn something about the meaning of an educational degree. "

    "Most likely this is because there is not much of a substantive gain of useful skills for the workforce (at least for what specific jobs people without highschool diplomas tend to go into). At the same time, the increase in income for people who have completed a high school diploma is likely because even though someone without a highschool might be just as qualified, someone with a highschool diploma is more likely to be hired for a higher-paying position."

    "In economics, this is viewed as evidence that the reason employers pay people with high school degrees more than those without degree is *not* that they think those who graduated high school have learned specific, useful skills. If that were the case, we would expect employee earnings to rise with every year of high school, since in each year of high school we learn more. \n",

    "Instead, this suggests employees pay high school graduates more because they think *the kind of people* who can finish high school are the *kind of people* who are likely to succeed at their jobs. Finishing high school, in other words, isn't about accumulating specific knowledge; it's about showing that you *are the kind of person* who can rise to the challenge of finishing high school, also suggesting you are also the kind of person who can succeed as an employee. \n",
